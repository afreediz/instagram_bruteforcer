if you are performing attacks using your own prebuild word list, give the exact location to the file when asked.

If you are performing attacks with the default passward lists, do not delete the password.txt and passowrd1.txt files in your sdcard.

if you prefer to create your own password list, make sure you give the correct location of the file.
